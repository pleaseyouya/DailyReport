An Introduction to Speech Recognition
==============================
```
The information contained in the speech signal can be represented by a set of parameters which has to be measured in short intervals of time to reflect the dynamic change of those parameters.

Classification task can be solved by several approaches. One of the easiest is to select several of the feature vectors for each of our classes and to declare the selected vectors as "prototypes" representing their class.

The classification of an unknown vector is accomplished as follows: Measure the distance of the unknown vector to all classes. Then assign the unknown vector to the class with the smallest distance. The distance of the unknown vector to a given class is defined as the smallest distance between the unknown vector and all of the prototypes representing the given class.

Speech signal is represented by a series of feature vectors which are computed every 10ms. A whole word will comprise dozens of those vectors, and the number of vectors of a word will depend on how fast a person is speaking. In speech recognition, we have to classify not only single vectors, but sequences of vectors.
